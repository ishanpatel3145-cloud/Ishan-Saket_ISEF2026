# Artificial intelligence (ChatGPT, OpenAI) was used to assist in generating initial Python code for in-silico peptide sequence mutagenesis. 
# The AI was used only for code structure and syntax. 
# All biological assumptions, substitution rules, parameter selection, and experimental design decisions were made by the student.
# The generated code was reviewed, modified, and validated by the student prior to use.
# Conservative substitutions based on physicochemical similarity,
# approximating positive-scoring substitutions in the BLOSUM62 matrix
